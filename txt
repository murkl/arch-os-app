    I have a slightly different error building on ARM:
    > makepkg -isf
    ==> Making package: paru 2.0.3-1 (Fri 22 Mar 2024 09:56:18 AM EDT)
    ==> Checking runtime dependencies...
    ==> Installing missing dependencies...
    error: target not found: libalpm.so>=14-64
    ==> ERROR: 'pacman' failed to install missing dependencies.
    
    
    It's an otherwise fully updated Raspi 3, including pacman-6.1.0-3, this seems to indicate that the ArchlinuxARM package supplies the correct version: https://archlinuxarm.org/packages/aarch64/pacman
    So I'm not sure why this dependency isn't met...
    EDIT: I suspect I'm running armv7h on this, which provides libalpm.so=14-32 instead. Does paru rely specifically on the 64bit version of this library? https://archlinuxarm.org/packages/armv7h/pacman
    EDIT 2: a workaround for this issue is to modify the PKGBUILD to require libalpm.so>=14, i.e. don't require the 64bit library.

    With my previously reported issue worked around, the package starts to build but fails due to an openssl dependency failing to compile, again on ArchlinuxARM armv7h
    The following warnings were emitted during compilation:
    
    warning: openssl-sys@0.9.101: cc: error: unrecognized command-line option ‘-mno-omit-leaf-frame-pointer’; did you mean ‘-fno-omit-frame-pointer’?
    
    error: failed to run custom build command for `openssl-sys v0.9.101`
    
    I have successfully switched to using the paru-bin AUR package with the same dependency workaround as my previous comment.

    had to install debugedit manually to get it built, should this be a build dep?

xiota commented on 2024-04-02 07:50 (UTC) (edited on 2024-04-02 07:52 (UTC) by xiota)
    @kelvan Install base-devel.

    Missing pkgconf (make) dependency

starquake commented on 2024-07-31 09:48 (UTC)
    @cwn: pkgconf is installed with base-devel. Which you should have installed before using the AUR. Using an AUR helper is okay but you should be familiar with building it yourself.

    @starquake
    not everyone needs the entirety of base-devel, pkgconf is still not marked as a dependency, which it should be. this shouldn't even be an argument.

    @crwn You are wrong. The wiki is clear on that front [1][2].
    base-devel is assumed to be installed when using the AUR (and building packages with makepkg generally speaking), dependencies of this package should not be included in makedepends array.
